# Workout Tracker
## Overview
I enjoy working out and coding so I wanted to mix the two worlds. This app is a way to log workouts and eventually see trends over time.

## Future Enhancements
1. Allow users to create profiles on a login screen and save user-entered workout data
2. Update profile page to pull in actual stats from what user has logged
3. Allow creation of custom workouts that can be saved so that they can be quickly logged in the future

~~4. Allow users to delete logged workouts~~

5. Keep the height of the table rows on the calendar fixed when adding new workouts
